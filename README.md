## Focus

These documents here help with both assessment and real-world operation. The focus here is to inform and to hopefully create an Amateur that can operate and integrate with our community from the time that their licence first appears on the ACMA database.

The focus is also to ensure that the AMateur also knows the rules and conventions... and operates within these rues and conventions.
