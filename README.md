# AR - VK Amater Radio Training Resources

## Focus

These documents here help with both assessment and real-world operation. The focus here is to inform and to hopefully create an Amateur that can operate and integrate with our community from the time that their licence first appears on the ACMA database.

The focus is also to ensure that the Radio Amateur also knows the Australian rules and conventions... and operates within these rules and conventions.

## Practical Assessment Guide 

There are many sample guides to be found on the Internet. Perhaps the most useful guide (though perhaps a little excessive) can be found at: https://www.julesworkshop.net/Zero%20to%20Practical.html .

The AMC's Practical Assessment documentation used to be available on the AMC's Website and still may be found via Google searches. This document useful but is now out of date and current practise is different.

The best resource can be foudn by examining the Foundation Syllabus - found at https://www.acma.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-02/ACMA%20recognition%20certificate%20%28Foundation%29%20Syllabus%20and%20examination%20information.pdf .

## Sample Test Questions

There are many sample question sets around on the Internet. Note that none of these questions come from  the Test pool nor are they sanctioned by the managers of the assessment process - The Australian Communications and Media Authority - ACMA. Useful guide questions can be found at:
